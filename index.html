                <h2>Kadiri Darasimi Adedoyin also known as FATHER^KD</h2>
                <p>I'm a passionate Front-End Developer with a strong eye for design and detail. I specialize in
                    building responsive, user-friendly websites and web applications using modern technologies like
                    HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as React. My focus is on creating seamless user
                    experiences that are both functional and visually appealing. Whether working independently or in a
                    team, I enjoy solving problems and turning ideas into interactive, real-world solutions. I'm
                    constantly learning and staying up to date with the latest web trends to deliver clean, efficient,
                    and scalable code.</p>
